===================

WordPress plugin to stop comment spam, all setup is optional.

This is a very simple plugin that will stop spam from being posted as comments on Wordpress based sites. It is based on a user being able to follow very simple instructions, such as rate this article 1 out of 5. Spambots don't get it, but people do.

When I created this, my comment spam went from 100 per day to zero.

The Settings page was added as an after thought to give future flexibility, but it works fine with the defaults.

There are only three options, which match the three fields that the plugin adds to the default comment form. Use it to change the answers to what is required in each field.
