yfp-spam-protection
===================

A WordPress plugin to stop robot-generated spam from being posted as a comment. It requires no configuration; all setup is optional. When I created this, my comment spam went from 100 per day to zero.

This is a very simple plugin that helps stop spam that is generated by robots from being posted as comments on WordPress sites. It is based on the concept that a user can follow very simple instructions that a spambot would have trouble doing. An example is to rate this article as "2" on a scale of 1-5.

The Settings page was added as an after thought to give future flexibility, but it works fine with the defaults.

There are only three options, which match the three fields that the plugin adds to the default comment form. The "correct" answer can be changed in each field.

Requires PHP 5.4 or greater.
